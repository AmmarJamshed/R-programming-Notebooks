This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```
We set a varible on the data 
```
install.packages("shiny")

library("shiny")
```
We go to the app creation server
```

library(ggplot2)
# create scatterplot and save it
myplot <- ggplot(data = train_house,
                  aes(x = MasVnrType, y = MasVnrArea)) +
             geom_point()
          
myplot1 <- ggplot(data = train_house,
                  aes(x = SaleType, y = SalePrice)) +
             geom_point()

myplot2 <- ggplot(data = train_house,
                  aes(x = ExterQual, y = MoSold)) +
